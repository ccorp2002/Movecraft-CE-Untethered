# **Movecraft-Community Edition : Untethered**

### **MUST** be using a Paper/Paper Fork (so like Purpur or something), We're ditching SpigotMC support with this one...

## Requires at least *Java 21+ & Minecraft: 1.20.4, 1.21.1, 1.21.3, 1.21.4*.




**New Mechanic-Features/Changes:**
 
- Fixes the creation of holes in the Water made by recently piloted & moving Ships.

- Redstone-Block Updates on moving crafts.

- Delayed the expensive (Both Server- and Client-side) Lighting Updates, by a few seconds (>5s) post movement. Should help with Player's FPS on large ships and makes Craft Movement visually smoother.

- New `config.yml` Options.
- New `ShipType.craft` Options.

- Improved how movecraft goes about block-setting and sending the changes to nearby players.
  
- Simplified/improved `sinkPercent` and `overallSinkPercent` craft options.
- Adds a `disablePercent` craft option, which determines the remaining percentage of all `moveBlocks`, before becoming *immobilized*.
  >
  > **sinkPercent** only applies to `flyBlocks`, like normal, however, `sinkPercent` now represents what percent of the original `flyBlock` must be remaining before sinking.
  >
  > **overallSinkPercent** applies to all blocks aboard the craft, and now represents what percent of the original block count must be remaining before sinking.
  >
  > **disablePercent** applies to all `moveBlocks` aboard the craft, and now represents what percent of the initial `moveBlock` count must be remaining before becoming disabled.


- Added back WASD Direct Control, use `/dc` to toggle it.

- Changes to how Fuel Items are burnt; Fuel may burn faster or slower compared to APDev/Mainstream Movecraft.

- New Total Blockcount Craft-HP Actionbar, displays the amount of Remaining blocks aboard the craft, over the amount of initial blocks. (Non-Air Blocks, in particular)

**API Changes:**

- Added new Fuel-type API/Event.
- TrackedLocations, used internally for various things, such as tracking Interior Air-Blocks aboard ships (Helps with mitigating the holes in the water), or keeping track of Fuel-Block Locations.
- Craft DataTags, Allow you to store arbitrary data "aboard" a Craft-Object. Is cleared upon the craft Releasing. Used for storing current Fly-Block & Move-Block count.
- The previously mentioned fuel item-changes, now allow you to register custom fuels via the CraftManager-API.
- SpeedModifier (SpeedMod) API, allowing developers to dynamically increase or decrease the speed of a given BaseCraft-Object.
  - Positive Numbers Decrease Speed/Increase delay of Movements; Negative Numbers do the opposite.

### Many *many* more changes, read the code to get a better idea...



## >>> EXPERIMENTAL ADDITION <<<
> The Following **ONLY** works if you are using the Paper Fork of:

> Enables:

> Multiworld-Threading (TLDR; Large Crafts will move without extensively lagging the main thread of the server.)
> *In the* `config.yml`

```IsMultithreaded: true/false```
## >>> EXPERIMENTAL ADDITION <<<



This is **another** maintained fork of Movecraft, which aims to maintain compatibility with APDev/Mainstream-Movecraft as well as provide Performance Changes & Fixes, API Upgrades, Ticking/Updating Redstone Components.

## Development Environment (Set-up Guide)

> Compiling this Version of Movecraft is a bit more involved due to the additional features & changes, specific to certain paper versions & forks.
> However, once the set-up process is complete, you will not need to repeat it again.
> 
### How To setup the development environment:
- Compile yourself a copy of PaperMC for each of the MC Versions this supports.
- You will need `1.20.4, 1.21.1, 1.21.3, 1.21.4` at the time of writing this.
- This can take a while, and be confusing. Suggest checking the Readme-section for of PaperMC over here [PaperMC](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper)


Once you have put your compiled "`server-<version>.jar`" jars in the `libs` folder, run the following to build Movecraft through the `maven` build tool.

An Alternative to the above method, is to run a PaperMC Server for around 15-30 seconds. Once this is done, copy the appropriate jars out of `YourServerFolder/versions/(1.21.1/1.21.3/...)`, into `libs` and rename the jars to "`server-<version>.jar`".
```
mvn clean install
```
A Compiled `Movecraft.jar` can be found in the `/target` directory.
